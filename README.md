# PCA Iris Data Project

This Python project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the famous Iris dataset. PCA is a technique for dimensionality reduction, often used for visualizing high-dimensional data and improving machine learning model performance.

## Overview

- **Iris Dataset:** The project uses the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in ML, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.

- **PCA:** Principal Component Analysis is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The reduced features are then used to train a machine learning model.

- **Machine Learning Model:** In this example, a Random Forest classifier is used as the machine learning model. The classifier is trained on the reduced features obtained from PCA.
